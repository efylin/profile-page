                            With very minimal coding experience, COMP1511 was my first taste of what a computer science degree actually
                            entailed. Despite it being one of my more difficult courses, requiring consistent effort with the endless
                            tasks that included weekly labs and assignments, it easily became a favourite. I enjoyed the fact that
                            after putting in the hard work, I could very tangibly see the results such as a smoothly running program.
                            Overall, this makes me excited to see what my future courses have in store, as well as enthusiastic to try
                            coding in other languages outside of uni.

                                    Coming into this film, I had low expectations since my friend's summary of the film sounded absolutely ridiculous.

                        This webpage was designed for UNSW DevSoc's Trainee Application. With the theme of Harmony/Discord in mind, I
                        decided to incorporate a toggle for light and dark mode which allowed for either a calmer harmonious colour
                        scheme or a more intense discordant colour scheme. Very new to HTML, CSS and JavaScript but had lots of fun making this!
